## Project Description

### What is the project about?
During the pandemic, I found out that I love cooking.
I knew right away that I would like to include this passion in my first full stack web project.  
This is how the website "Programmers can cook" was born.
It's a combination of an open recipe base and forum about healthy eating and cooking.
### Special requirements

  - functions - including names, variables, etc.
  - triggers
* PostgreSQL had to be the database of application.
* The graphic interface had to be in Polish.
* The use of ORM was prohibited.
